# Dalley Cats

Dalley Cats are NFTs generated by the DALL-E Artificial Intelligence (AI). Dalley Cats can jump bewtween blockchains. Dalley Cats implement the ONFT standard from LayerZero. Images and metadata are stored on IPFS/Filecoin.

# How it was Made

Artwork for Dalley Cats is generated at mint time by AI (DALL-E by OpenAI). Choose a color and an accessory and a Cat will be generated with a background color represent the "birth chain" of the Cat. Once the image has been generated, it is stored on IPFS (via the nft.storage service) and NFT metadata JSON is also saved to IPFS.

The Dalley Cats smart contracts adhere to the ERC721 and ONFT standards. The Universal ONFT standard enables minting NFTs from the collection ony any of the supported chains and the ability to send NFTs from one chain to another.

# Next Steps
- find a co-founder to do Community Management
- contract refinements
- pricing of mainnet mint?
- choose ~10 chains for mainnet launch
- deploy to mainnets
